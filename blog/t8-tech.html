             Rails<br /><br />
             My thoughts on the framework.<br /><br />

         Rails is a programming framework written in the object-oriented language, Ruby. The framework was created based on the idea that there was, in fact, a most efficient and easiest way to use ruby. The Rails creators were attempting to remove unnecessary syntax in order to be able to write less code, but have the ability to do more. The Rails framework has a set criteria for how things should be done within and at the same time discourages alternative ways. The idea from this being that there is a best way to do things and with this you will be able to right good code faster. Rails is a huge advocate of DRY. Meaning that with Rails they remove any redundancies that may have one point been needed.

         Having only ever taken an intro class to Ruby on Rails there is only such much I can say about it. It is nice that Rails does a lot of coding for your (the whole MVC and scaffolding dealio), but at the same time I always feel so restricted when using it. But since I haven’t used it that much maybe being forced into a certain path makes one more efficient? As much as I was fascinated with Ruby on Rails, I often felt trapped. I am certain my mindset will change when I get use it more and produce more complex web applications.

        <p class="post">
         Although I have some reservations of Rails as a whole, I do like this idea of being able to quickly piece together an MVP. Coming from an HCI (UX background), it would make the whole process of user testing and such much easier. Especially if you are able to exchange pieces out as easily as it seems. I realize this is a blog technical blog post gone awry, but it still had some useful tidbits!
