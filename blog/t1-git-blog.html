          Once upon a time there was a dog named Branch. Branch loved to dig holes so one day he decided to undertake a massive digging project. Branch decide he was going to dig a hole that was four feet deep and four feet wide. At the end of day 1 Branch had dug eight inches into the ground and his hole was eight inches wide. Branch awakens the next morning to a rude surprise. His silly buddy Merge has filled in his hole with two inches of dirt and grass. After barking a Merge endlessly, Branch decided he would simply have to do the work. If only Branch had some sort of version control for is hole digging! Unfortunately, Branch is a dog and doesn't have the capacity to create such a thing :).

          Version control is awesome. Having the ability to see what changes you've made and when you've made them is super useful. Git helps you track these changes by recording all the changes you make to files. One can view these changes by using the commands 'git hist' and git 'log'. Git also gives you the ability to flag different versions of a file through git tag that way you can easily go back to them.

          Using GitHub to store your code is good for multiple reasons. The two major ones that I can think of include your harddrive failing and if you want to make collaboration easier. Having a remote version of git can give as many people as you want access to this repository. This gives them the ability to work on and push branches to the repository and allows you to check them before they are merged. All commits are also saved and visible on GitHub. It is a visual, more social version of git, ant it's awesome!
