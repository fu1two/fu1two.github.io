             Conflict<br /><br />
             Strong Personalities<br /><br />

         For this example I’ll go back to a class of mine back in graduate school.  This was a practicum class run by a design firm that my school partnered with. Within this class we were split into teams. I was the only male on my team. There were two very strong personalities on my team and I would clash with them indirectly on occasion. The conflict was never verbal, but more of them dismissing all my ideas and most of what I would say during our group meetings. It was basically their way or nothing.  I had put a lot of effort into an idea for a part of our final project and it was essentially dismissed. The girl who led our group sidestepped around it completely. It was an awful feeling to say the least.
        </p>
        <p class="post">
         The source of the conflict, or potential conflict, was that I didn’t speak up enough and she spoke up too much.  And ignored my thoughts the few times I did speak up. I felt disappointed more than anything else. I wasn’t really mad. My ideas being dismissed made me feel saddened more than anything. A lack of purpose is the worst feeling ever. And when your ideas are never incorporated it often feels like that.
        </p>
        <p class="post">
         I resolved the conflict internally within myself.  I spoke to another member of my group about how I felt. She too stated that she often felt that her ideas were dismissed by the two stronger personalities. It helped to know that I wasn’t in that boat alone. In order to solve it with the least resistance, I simply put my efforts into what they assigned me of their ideas. I figured if I wasn’t going to be able to work on my own suggestions, then I should at least do the best I can with what I am given. 
        </p>
        <p class="post">
         If I could go back I would definitely speak up more. I would be sterner about my ideas and not fall back on my heels so easily. I learned that the path of least resistance is not always the best path or correct.
