           		A Tough Subject: Stereotype Threat
            </p>
          <p class="post">
      		Stereotype threat is the risk unintentionally confirming a negative stereotype pertaining to one’s affiliations. (Steele & Aronson, 1995). This is to say that the potential of being viewed as one of these stereotypes promotes fear within the individual an in turn causes anxiety and a drop in performance. Steele first showed this in multiple tests done that displayed a poor performance on standardized testing among Black college students when their race was emphasized. (Compared to white students.)
          </p>
          <p class="post">
          	Now I realize that these studies don’t really apply since I am, in fact, not Black. But the sentiment is similar. Being Asian (half Asian mind you), comes with something that feels like both a stereotype threat, but also something that is positive. After doing some research I stumbled about something referred to as stereotype promise. A stereotype threat because it reinforces this idea of having to be exceptional in almost all one does, but at the same this pressure helps to push one to succeed. A sort of double edged sword, I suppose. Now it’s kind of funny. If ever I actually felt that this stereotype threat affected me negatively in any way whatsoever I would probably deny it. I would see it as an excuse for my fall in performance or whatever it was applying to at the time. (But is it the anxiety that is causing this denial?) Be this true or not, I feel that the stereotype promise does help me to push myself and at least attempt to reach my highest potential. And maybe it is because of this balance of promise and threat that I don’t fall by the wayside. That those who are affected by stereotype threat don’t have the luxury of a positive stereotype. Obviously, this is all conjecture. My stream of though based on something I have only spent about an hour reading about. There is certainly a lot more to read and said about stereotype threat, but at this point I do not have the knowledge to say anything more on the subject.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
          	How do we reduce stereotype threat? This is the million dollar question. I would say be as transparent about the issue as possible. Teach those involved about the issues that come with stereotype threat. Makes sure to frame everything in a fashion that will not promote threat, and emphasize that all of this current group is in the same boat. I would also make sure to state that ALL performing whatever task have the ability to achieve the highest outcome. I guess it just comes down to educating and being mindful of the context in which you are in when structuring tasks.
