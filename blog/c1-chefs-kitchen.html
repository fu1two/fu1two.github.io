     I am really happy to have watched this Fireside chat with Shereef. This is exactly what I was hoping the DBC experience would be like. Iâ€™m excited to go into the program with a sense of wonder and unknowing. I look forward to learning from the instructors and my peers, as well as being able to help others with my own knowledge! A lot of what Shereef said really put by mind at easy. I will now go into this program with a mindset that is both fearful and welcoming of the challenges that lie ahead (and avoid the menu analogy mindset). My mantra for my life, in general, is that balance is everything, and I feel that it applies very well to this program.  I am ready to embrace anything that comes my, and helping others along the way.
