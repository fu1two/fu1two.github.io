           		Long Live Diversity!<br /><br />
           		5.3.15

          <p class="post">
          		The tech industry is not diverse. Saying that is an understatement. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the software workforce consists of 80% males, 20% females, 61% White, 29 % Asian , 5% Hispanic, and 4% black. I would say that is a bit lopsided. This is a problem that needs to be solved.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
				This lack of diversity within the industry causes those within to become out of touch and unaware. Having more women and a wider range of ethnicities would only help bolster the industry. Point of views different from that of the majority only help to see gaps and trends that wouldn't be seen with out them. Also, studies show that a more diverse team will come up with better products than one that is not. And that most certainly has to do with the different point of views brought to the table. 
		  </p>
		  <p class="post">
				In order to bring in more females and other ethnicities I feel that it is important to start from the beginning. Elementary school. I am aware that there are already a few programs that have been implemented to teach younger students basic code as well as basic computer literacy, and it's a start, but I feel that is has to be much more far spread to have an effect. Even if thee young students don't end up going into computer science or the like, at least they are familiar with coding. That they now have the ability to have a conversation with a co-worker who may be a programmer. That this ability to speak on something that has become so ubiquitous in our every day lives. And communication within a workplace is key. Better communication equates to less misinterpretations, less errors, saved money, and so on.

				This is something that could indirectly alleviate some other problems that the tech industry faces and is definitely a step in the right direction.
