         I jest! Of course we need to ask questions. Questions are quite possibly the most important part of learning. For how can we understand without inquiring?! Okay I'm done being silly (for now..), time to get down to brass tacks. I have not really asked any questions within the DBC community so I will just go over some best practices for asking good questons using made up examples.

         <strong>Dat Question Tho</strong>
         The subject is so important, but often forgotten since in your mind it is such a small part of the question. But it is important. Especially if you are posting on a Stack Overflow, or any other sort of question/answer site. This is because when users are on the site, all they see is a list of questions. If the title is vague it is less likely to gain the interest of the potential user that could be able to answer it. Be as descriptive as possible, but at the same time succinct. Don't overload the answerer with more information than is necessary. At least not until they have accessed the actual post. The question needs to put the potential answerer in the correct frame of mind before even clicking on the question. They should have a good idea of an approach before even reading the details.
        </p>
        <p class="post">
         <strong>When I code, you code, we code</strong>
         It is important that you provide code to the users in order for them to replicate the issue that you are having. Do not post pages of code within your question. Post a simplified version of your issue. Something that is simpler but produces the same error. You could also link the user to a live working version of the issue (JSfiddle). Other small, but important, things to keep in mind are proper tagging and proof-reading your post. Proper tagging will allow people of the correct background to easily find the questions that they are most able to answer. Proof-reading is important since it could potentially change the answer that you will receive. 

        We can rebuild these questions, we have the technology.
