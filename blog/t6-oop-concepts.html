           		A Tough Subject: Stereotype Threat
            </p>
          <p class="post">
      		Ruby contains five different types of variables CONSTANT, $global, @@class, @instance, and local. For each of these different variable types, each has its own scope. These scopes range from all encompassing, to almost no reach whatsoever.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
          	A CONSTANT is accessible on all levels within that ruby file. A $global variable is also accessible on all levels. The difference between a CONSTANT and @global variable being that a CONSTANT doesn’t like to be changed while the program is being ran. Which is reflected in the name of the variable I suppose. A @@class variable is one that applies to all instances of the class that it is within. So suppose we make multiple instances of a class. If we change the value of a @@class variable for one of these objects, it will also change for the rest of them. Where on the other hand, an @instance variable is on that only applies to that specific instance of a class. So if we were to change the value of an @instance variable in one object it would still maintain the default value within the other object. The last type of variable is the local variable. The local variable has the smallest scope out of all the variables listed thus far. The local variable only applies to that which it is contained in, be it a method or something else.
          </p>
          <p class="post">
          	When to use each type of variable comes down to how large you want its scope to be. Also if you want the variable to have the ability to be changed with little resistance. It would probably be best to say that one should make the scope of a variable as small as it needs to be. That is to say only let it be accessed by that which it absolutely needs to be accessed by.
