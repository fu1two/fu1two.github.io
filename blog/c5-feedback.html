           		Pairing and Feedback<br/><br/>5.10.15

          	<b>Pairing:</b><br/><br/>
			I really enjoyed pairing with others. I love being able to see how people’s minds work while they are working on these challenges. It is always nice to have a second set of eyes on the code. I remember a couple days ago I was attempting to use the `include?` method. I stared at my code and couldn’t figure out for the life of me what was wrong so I walked away from my computer. When I returned I realize that it was pluralized. A second person would often be able to catch that and in turn help progress through the challenge with a higher efficiency. Pairing with someone promotes this sense of camaraderie. When you both are able to figure something out together it is incredibly rewarding and helps strengthen bonds within the cohort. The only time pairing has really bed frustrating is when communication is hard. Be it from background noise or from a temperamental Internet connection. That is why the ideal situation would be in person rather than remote.

          <p class="post">
          	<b>Feedback:</b><br/><br/>
			It was really nice to see that most people had positive things to say about me. It was also incredibly encouraging because I try my hardest to make people feel comfortable while working remotely on the challenges, which inherently can be a bit awkward. It was helpful because it let me know what I’m doing well and of course the things I can work on. The next time I work with my pair I am going to make sure I clearly state everything I am trying to say. Often when I am not sure about something I will turn inward and just skip it. This results in a bunch of half sentences being vocalized. What I have to realize is even though they may be incorrect they still might help us in the end because it eliminates those and can possibly direct to the correct solution. Writing the positive part of the feedback is incredibly enjoyable. Hearing positive things about the work you’re doing is always encouraging. The most difficult problem is I occasionally have an issue writing constructive criticism because I don’t want to come off mean at all. I do understand that it usually doesn’t come off this way, but is still hard for me nonetheless.

          </p>
          <p class="post">
          	Overall I feel that pairing is very useful. Being able to see other perspectives, how people learn, what syntax they use, really just bolsters our own knowledge.
			Feedback is equally as important because it will help to make these sessions even more enriching.
